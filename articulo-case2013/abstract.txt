Linux embedded systems are often found in closed-box products. The present
work documents the process by which such a closed-box, off-the-shelf product,
has been analysed to study how it is built, how it is powered by Linux, and
how its software can be updated or modified to adapt the device to other
usages. The final result, after the described procedure is applied, is a
generic, embedded Linux development board, suitable for arbitrary purposes.
Our practical experiments targeted an Encore ENTC1000 product
marketed as a thin client device for remote desktops.
